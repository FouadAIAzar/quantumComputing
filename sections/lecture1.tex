\subsubsection{From bits to qubits}
The lassical states for computation are either "0" or "1". However, in quantum mechanics, a state can be in \textit{superposition}, which means the binary state can exist simultaneously. These superpositions allow calculations to be performed much faster. This is because we can perform all the calculations of the many states at the same time. 

The lecturer points out here indirectly, that using three binary bits, we can count to 8 $[(000),(111)]$, however, with 2 qubits, we can 

We can construct some quantum algorithms that can exponentially speed up processes. HOWEVER, once we measure the superpositions state, it collapses into one of its states. Therefore, it is not that easy to design useful quantum algorithms.

But that doesn't mean it's imposible. The interference effects is used here to make it possible. \footnote{honestly, I do not understand how this works}

\subsubsection{Dirac Notation and Density Matrices}
These are used to describe quantum states. For example, $let$ $a,b \in \mathbb{C}^2$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $ ket:\ \ket{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\ a_1 \end{pmatrix} $
    \item $ bra:\ \bra{b} = \ket{b}^\dagger= \begin{pmatrix} b_0 \\ b_1 \end{pmatrix}^\dagger = (b_o^* \ \ b_1^*) $
    \item $ bra-ket:\ \braket{b}{a} = a_0b_0^* + a_1b_1^*  = \braket{a}{b}^* \in \mathbb{C}$ 
    \item $ket-bra:\ \ketbra{a}{b} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        a_0b_0^* & a_0b_1^*\\
        a_1b_0^* & a_1b_1^*
    \end{pmatrix}$
\end{itemize}

The ket seems seems to be a straight-forward column matrix with possible complex elements. The bra vector is the same as a ket vector, but denoted with a \textit{dagger} $^\dagger$ symbol, which implies that it is transformed into a row vector, whose elements are conjugated, i.e.:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{pmatrix}x_0 + iy_0 \\ x_1 + iy_1 \end{pmatrix} \to (x_0 - iy_0 \ \  x_1 - iy_1) 
\end{equation*}

The bra-ket notation seems to imply a dot-product between the former conjugate bra vector $b$ and the latter ket vector $a$.

a ket-bra notation multiplies a column and row vector which results in a $[2 \times 2]$ matrix.

\begin{center}Dirac Notation\end{center}
bra–ket notation, or Dirac notation, is used ubiquitously to denote quantum states. The notation uses angle brackets,  $\langle$ and $\rangle$ , and a vertical bar $|$, to construct "bras" and "kets". 

A ket is of the form  $|v\rangle$ . Mathematically it denotes a vector, $\boldsymbol{v}$, in an abstract (complex) vector space $V$, and physically it represents a state of some quantum system.

A bra is of the form $\langle f|$. Mathematically it denotes a linear form $f:V\to \mathbb {C}$, i.e. a linear map that maps each vector in $V$ to a number in the complex plane C $\mathbb{C}$ . Letting the linear functional $\langle f|$ act on a vector $|v\rangle$ is written as $\langle f|v\rangle \in \mathbb {C}$.

The $\ket{0}$ is defined as $\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}$ and $\ket{1}$ as $\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix}$, which are orthogonal proven by:

\begin{equation*}
    \braket{0}{1} = 1\cdot 0 + 0\cdot 1 = 0
\end{equation*}

Taking the ket-bra, we find that:
\begin{align*}
    \ketbra{0}{0} &=  \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}\\
    \ketbra{1}{1} &=  \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

In general, any matrix $\rho$:
\begin{equation*}
    \rho = \begin{pmatrix}
    \rho_{00} & \rho_{01}\\
    \rho_{10} & \rho_{11}
    \end{pmatrix} = \rho_{00} \ketbra{0}{0} + \rho_{01} \ketbra{0}{1} + \rho_{10} \ketbra{1}{0} + \rho_{11} \ketbra{1}{1} 
\end{equation*}

We learned these \textit{Direc Notation}, in order to describe \textit{density matrices}, i.e., normalized, positive Hermitian operators, which is commonly called $\rho$. The properties a density matrix $\rho$ are $tr(\rho) = 1$,  $\rho \geq 0$ and $\rho = \rho^\dagger$.

\begin{mdframed}[hidealllines=true,backgroundcolor=black!60, fontcolor = white]
\begin{center} Trace of a Matrix \end{center}
In linear algebra, the trace of a square matrix $A$, denoted tr($A$), is defined to be the sum of elements on the main diagonal (from the upper left to the lower right) of $A$. The trace is only defined for a square matrix $(n \times n)$. 
\end{mdframed}
\begin{mdframed}[hidealllines=true,backgroundcolor=black!60, fontcolor = white]
\begin{center} Hermitian Matrix \end{center}
a Hermitian matrix (or self-adjoint matrix) is a complex square matrix that is equal to its own conjugate transpose—that is, the element in the i-th row and j-th column is equal to the complex conjugate of the element in the j-th row and i-th column, for all indices i and j: 
\end{mdframed}

Expanding on this information we understand that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $tr(\rho) = \rho_{00} + \rho_{11} = 1$
    \item $\bra{\Psi}\rho\ket{\Psi} \geq  0 \ \forall \ \Psi \Leftrightarrow \text{all eigenvalues } \geq 0$
    \item $\rho^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} 
    \rho^*_{00} & \rho^*_{01}\\
    \rho^*_{10} & \rho^*_{11}
    \end{pmatrix}$
\end{itemize}

All quantum states are normalized. Our convention is $\braket{\Psi}{\Psi} = 1$, e.g.:
$$
\ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{0} + \ket{1}) = \begin{pmatrix}
\sfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\sfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Spectral decomposition means that for every density matrix $\rho$ there exits an orthogonal basis ${\ket{i}}$, such that $\rho =\sum_i\lambda_i \ketbra{i}{i}$, where $\ket{i}$: eigenstates, $\lambda_i$: eigenvalues, $\sum_i \lambda_i = 1$.

A density matrix can be called pure, if $\rho = \ketbra{\Psi}{\Psi}$, otherwise it is mixed. If $\rho$ is pure, then one eigenvalue is 1, and therefore all other eigenvalues are zero. I.e. $tr(\rho^2) = \sum_i \lambda_i^2 = 1$ if $\rho$ is pure, otherwise it is mixed state $tr(\rho^2) < 1$.

Looking at some examples: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\rho = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix} = \ketbra{0}{0}$, $\rho$ is pure.
    
    \item $\rho = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0\\
    0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{2}(\ketbra{0}{0} + \ketbra{1}{1})$, the $tr(\rho)$ is less than 1,  making $\rho$ a mixed state.
    
    \item \begin{align*}
            \rho &= \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
            \ \ 1 & -1 \\
            -1 & \ \ 1
            \end{pmatrix}\\ &= \frac{1}{2} (\ketbra{0}{0} - \ketbra{0}{1} -     \ketbra{1}{0} + \ketbra{1}{1}) \\ &=     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}-\ket{1})\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\bra{0}-\bra{1})
        \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

I am a bit lost on example number three. I don't see how she rearranged them so quickly. This next colored segment is my calculations to better understand the former. Skip it if you don't need it.

\begin{mdframed}[hidealllines=true,backgroundcolor=black!60, fontcolor = white]
\begin{center}What the hell just happened?\end{center}
Let's calculate the ket-bra's of 10 and 01.
\begin{align*}
    \ketbra{0}{1} &= \begin{pmatrix}
    1 \\
    0
    \end{pmatrix} \cdot (0 \ \ 1)^\dagger\\
    &=\begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix}\\
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
    \ketbra{1}{0} &= \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    1
    \end{pmatrix} \cdot (1 \ \ 0)^\dagger\\
    &=\begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix}\\
\end{align*}
Now let's draw out all the matrices from example three, line 2 \textbf{without} the coefficient:
$$
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
-
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}
-
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & -1 \\ 
-1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Indeed, this equals:
$$
(\ketbra{0}{0} - \ketbra{0}{1} -     \ketbra{1}{0} + \ketbra{1}{1})
$$
Now for that rearrangement from the third line, it seems like you can treat them algebraically and just factor it out?
$$
\ketbra{0}{0} - \ketbra{0}{1} -     \ketbra{1}{0} + \ketbra{1}{1} = \ket{0}(\bra{0} - \bra{1}) - \ket{1}(\bra{0}+\bra{1}) 
$$
That didn't help. The only other thing I can do to make sense of this is by treating it like a quadratic formula, however, the commutative law doesn't apply
$$
\ketbra{0}{0} - \ketbra{0}{1} -     \ketbra{1}{0} + \ketbra{1}{1} = a^2 - ab - ba + b^2 = (a+b)(a-b) = (\ket{0}-\ket{1})\cdot (\bra{0}-\bra{1})
$$
But this is flimsy at best and I believe I need to revist this later.

For this course, it will be assumed that all density matrices are pure. Since a pure state means that we know exactly what all the information about the quantum system is, as opposed to the mixed/superposition state.

For me I need to understand some quantum mechanics, because this sounds a little confusing, however, I pulled a definition off of Quora that is seems to simplify things a bit:

\begin{mdframed}[hidealllines=true,backgroundcolor=black!60, fontcolor = white]
A mixed state is a state of imperfect knowledge. Whereas a pure state represents perfect knowledge of the state.

Mathematically, the pure state is some state that can be represented as a superposition of measurement outcomes. As such, the coefficients associated with the various states that correspond to the different measurement outcomes must have complex coefficients. That then means the measurement outcome probabilities are given by the Born rule. This is a probability rule that is unique to quantum mechanics.

A mixed state also contains measurement possibilities that are included using standard probabilities. That means the coefficients are real numbers. Standard probabilities come about through lack of information about a system. This lack of information can be attributed to the true state being a nonlocal entangled state, and the measurements are purely local, so all the entanglement information is missing.

Therefore, quantum mechanics can use both the standard probabilities of classical statistics and the quantum probabilities associated with quantum superpositions.

You find mixed states referred to a lot in decoherence theory. For example, the light from a common thermal light bulb is in a mixed state, while the light from a laser is in a pure state.
